        <h3>Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn</h3>
        <p id="review-1-details">This game, made for the nintendo wii, is one of my favorites. It isn't like the newer fire emblem games, with lots of cutscenes and animations,
            however it tells a wonderful story. There is character development, surprises in the plot, and overall wonderfully fun gameplay. This game is expensive on the market now,
            but if you have the money, it's worth a try. Like I said, it's not like the newer fire emblem games, but in many ways it is much better.
