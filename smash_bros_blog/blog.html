            <h2>General Info</h2>
            <p>My name is Peter and I'm trying to get better at playing Marth in Super Smash Bros Melee. He is a
                difficult character to learn for competitive play as he requires precision in his movement and his
                attacks to do well. This here is a for fun website to make my learning of Marth more enjoyable and also
                to have somewhere to keep track of my progress and see how I've improved over time. </p>

            <h2>How I've Improved</h2>
            <p>Date: July 8th 2024</p>
            <hr>
            <p>WaveDashing: 3/10... I give myself this score because I can still only wave dash correctly 80% of
                the time, with perfect wavedash timing about 50%. And that is only in practice, and is difficult to
                implement in a match.</p>
            <p>ChainGrabbing: 2/10... I give myself this score as I still have difficulty chaingrabbing Fox on FD even
                when he is not moving or airdodging, besides some slight DI. I am still a ways from using this in a
                match</p>
            <p>JC Grabbing: 6/10... I think this because it seems fairly easy to learn, and very doable already after
                trying it for one day. However, at times I accidentally jump and then nair instead of JC Grab</p>
            <p>Dash Dancing: 7/10... I am very good at the practice of dash dancing itself, and have almost mastered it
                in this form, since I very rarely mess it up and have Marth just do slight turn arounds instead of
                dashing, but it DOES still happen sometimes. I still have trouble knowing when to use it, even though I
                can use it in a match.</p>
            <p>Landing Attacks: 6/10... Marth is difficult because of how precise you have to be with him, but I am
                getting much better with practice and predicting enemy movement. </p>
            <p>Mental Strategy: 4/10... This is the one that I think might take the longest for me to learn, but overall
                I can do a decent job predicting enemy movement if I have played against them for a few matches. I do
                not however, have the muscle memory in my other methods and moveset to be able to consciously realize
                how my opponent is punishing me for certain attacks, not to mention noticing what THEY do that I can
                punish.</p>
            <p>Defense: 5/10... Marth doesn't have a very effective shield, and against characters that are quick or
                grab easily, I tend to be predictable with when I shield. I have gotten much much better about rolling,
                and I almost never roll anymore, thanks to a training feature on 20XX melee.</p>
            <p>Short Hops: 7/10... I have gotten much better over the past week or two with short hopping. I am slowly
                but surely developing it into my muscle memory and it is becoming more natural to me.</p>
            <p>Overall Movement Rating: 5/10... Still have trouble with wavedashing and dash dancing and I don't even
                know half the technical terms for all the ways to move in this game, but I HAVE eliminated my
                predictable roll and increased muscle memory with short hops and fast falling.</p>

            <h2>Things to Work On</h2>
            <p>Date: July 8th 2024</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The things I want to work on this week, or until my next overview: </p>
            <p>1. Movement: Very important to work on wavedashing and dash dancing and continue making muscle memory for
                short hops and fast falls. Greater focus should be on when to dash dance as opposed to when to WaveDash,
                and also practice wavedashing.</p>
            <p>2. Grabs: I want to do well against Fox, and I know that grabbing is very effective with Marth, and
                especially against Fox. I tend to chaingrab the best at 20% - 45%.</p>
            <p>3. Not being Predictable: This is my most important mental game that I should definitely start with.
                Nearly eliminating my use of rolls has significantly helped, but I need to make sure I'm not just moving
                or attacking just for the sake of moving and attacking. I need to plan and strategize those things.</p>

            <h2>Tips From the Professionals</h2>
            <p>Date: July 8th 2024</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Mew2King in his guide for Marth to Salem said that it is best in most situations to DI up and towards the
                opponent. He also said Marth's best throws are forward and up throw. Should keep this in mind.</p>
            <p>Being able to beat Fox determines how good I am at Melee. I need to mentally emphasize the economy of
                motion and practice good spacing. Also, another tip is to be careful shielding since Fox is quick and
                can grab easily. Use chaingrab against him at the right percents. Don't allow free laser hits. More info
