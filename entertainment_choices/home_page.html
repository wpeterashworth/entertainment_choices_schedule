            <p>This is a website designed to be changed and is only for Peter Ashworth's personal use. It allows me to Remember what entertainment
        I should play or read and when. By having this schedule, I can have a less overwhelming amount of options, and will therefore be much less bored.
        If you don't understand then you're probably not Peter and shouldn't be on this website.</p>
            <p>PS: There are two categories: Video Games and Books... Any more forms of entertainment will be added on later. The books will need to be edited when I finish reading them.
                Either the video games or books will need editing if I add more of them.
